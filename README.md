# WTWR Project (TripleTen Bootcamp)

## Description

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. My goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, build an API, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine.

The WTWR application provides users with a clothing selection based on the weather in their area, using the Open Weather API. The add clothes modal is accessible in the header and the profile tabs, allowing users to upload their own clothing items for selection. The clothing item modal allows users to delete clothing items when necessary. A user is also able to sign up, log in, log out, toggle the temperature scales, and edit their profile information using similarly designed modals.

Sprint 11 used a mock json-server and a db.json file to handle all CRUD operations, but in Sprint 12, I implemented an Express application, MongoDB database, server with an API and user authorization, configured the first routes and controllers, and handled all errors using the Collection Runner in Postman for testing. In Sprint 15, I deployed both the backend Express and frontend React projects to a remote server using a Google Cloud VM instance.
